		<h3>From today's featured article</h3>
		<p><span class= "higlighted-text bolditalictext">Halo Wars</span> (released 2009) is a <span class= "higlighted-text">real-time strategy</span> video game developed by <span class= "higlighted-text">Ensemble Studios</span> and published by <span class= "higlighted-text">Microsoft Game Studios</span> for the <span class= "higlighted-text">Xbox 360 video game console</span>. The game is set in the science fiction universe of the <span class= "higlighted-text italictext">Halo series</span> in the year 2531, 21 years before the events of <span class= "higlighted-text italictext">Halo: Combat Evolved</span>. The player leads human soldiers aboard the warship Spirit of Fire in an effort to stop an ancient fleet of ships from falling into the hands of the genocidal alien <span class= "higlighted-text">Covenant</span>. Halo Wars was unveiled at the 2006 <span class= "higlighted-text">X06</span> Xbox show. Ensemble was closed by Microsoft before the game's release, but <span class= "higlighted-text">Robot Entertainment</span> was founded soon after by many of Ensemble's former employees; this new company continued to support Halo Wars with updates and <span class= "higlighted-text">downloadable content</span>. The game received generally positive reviews. Reviewers lauded the game's pre-rendered cinematics, attention to detail in replicating the Halo universe, and intuitive control scheme. Complaints against the game included the lack of an option to play as the Covenant faction in campaign mode as well as the lack of strategic options during play. The game sold one million units worldwide through March 2009. (<span class= "higlighted-text boldtext">Full article...</span>)<p>
