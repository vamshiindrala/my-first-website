Background

Telangana statehood struggle is one of the longest peoples movements in the world. The six decade struggle, which began in early 1950s, has reached its goal in February 2014.

The first statehood movement of 1950s led to the States Reorganization Commission recommending the Telangana state (then called Hyderabad State) in 1955 itself. But hectic lobbying by Seemandhra political leaders resulted in Telangana being forcibly merged with Andhra state to form Andhra Pradesh state in November 1956.

Telangana leaders, who suspected that Andhra region would dominate Telangana in all aspects, insisted that certain guarantees be given to Telangana before merger. Thus a Gentleman Agreement with safeguards to Telangana region was signed by leaders of both the regions.

But, even before the ink on the Gentlemanâ€™s Agreement dried up, Andhra leaders flouted all safeguards and broke all promises made to Telangana region.

Telangana was discriminated in budgetary allocations, jobs and educational opprtunities belonging to Telangana region were usurped by Andhras.

Students and employees of the region, rose up in an agitation demanding separate Telangana state in 1969. However, this movement for statehood was crushed by the state and central governments in 1969. About 370 youngsters were brutally gunned down by the police.

In May 1971, Telangana Praja Samithi headed by Marri Chenna Reddy won 10 of the 14 Parliament seats in Telangana region. But, very soon, Chenna Reddy merged with Congress party.
