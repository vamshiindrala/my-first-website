<p>I am an Electrical and electronics graduate student passionate about learning new concepts and try my level best to gain knowledge about them.<br/>
<div><h3>EDUCATION:</h3>
Graduation:University of Bridgeport, Connecticut  <br/>                                                                                                   
Major:Masters of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering	<br/>	                                                        Over all GPA:3.37/4	<br/>         
Under Graduation<br/>
Percentage:84.2<br/>
University:Jawaharlal  Nehru Technological University, <br/>
Hyderabad              <br/>                                                                       
Major:Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering
<h3>TECHNICAL SKILLS:</h3>
Programming Languages: C, C++ <br/>
Tools and Technologies: MATLAB, ADC <br/>
Operating Systems: MS Windows XP/7/8/10, Linux.<br/>

<h3>ACADEMIC PROJECTS:</h3>
<h4>SOLAR POWER GENERATION USING A SEVEN LEVEL INVERTER:</h4>
In this project I designed a graphical version of the ac power generation using the solar panels i.e.., the dc power generated by the solar panels is very less in range (voltage) hence a dc to dc converter is used to enhance the voltage range and we can even regulate it and then a seven level inverter is used to generate a desired ac output voltage which can also be controlled, the project has been demonstrated using MATLAB software. 
<h3>UNDER GRADUATION PROJECTS:</h3>
<h4>AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT CONTROLLING USING LDR BASED TECHNOLOGY:</h4>
This project demonstrates the way of switching on/off of the street light which is possible by using LDR, IR technology. This project works on the basis of light intensity.  

<h4>ENHANCEMENT OF POWER QUALITY IN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM USING D-STATCOM</h4>
This project deals with enhancement of power quality (voltage sags). In this project the voltage sags during the fault condition can be eliminated by using a device D-STATCOM.


<h3>STRENGHTS</h3>
Good organizing skills to meet the deadlines.	
Strong willingness to learn more technical skills.


<h3>EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES:</h3>
Worked as organizer for the event PAPER PRESENTATION for NIETROLIGHTZ-2K11.</br>
Won the cricket tournaments at the school and college levels.</br>
