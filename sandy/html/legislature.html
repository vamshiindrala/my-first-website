The Telangana Legislative Assembly is the lower house of the Telangana Legislature. As of 2014 the Legislative Assembly of Telangana consists of 119 Members. The current Speaker of the Assembly is Madhusudhana Chary of TRS.

The members of the Vidhana Sabha are directly elected by people through adult franchise.

Each constituency elects one member of the assembly. Members are popularly known as M.L.A's. The assembly is elected using the simple plurality or "first past the post" electoral system. The elections are conducted by the Election Commission of India.

The normal term of the members lasts for five years. In case of death, resignation or disqualification of a member, a by-election is conducted for constituency represented by the member. The party which wins the most seats becomes the ruling party.
