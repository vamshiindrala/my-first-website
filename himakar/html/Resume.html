		<h3>EXPERIENCE</h3>
		<h4>Intern at Defense Research Development Laboratory (DRDL), India Jan'14- May'14</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><p>PROJECT: Tracking of Maneuvering target using Kalman based estimator (MATLAB) - - Implementation of effective 2D, 3D kalman filter for filtering noise content in received signal. We estimated the maneuvering aircraft state vectors (position, velocity, acceleration) using kalman filter (KF) and its variants like extended kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF).</p></li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Analog Circuit Design: Designed, Simulated and laid out single stage amplifiers, differential amplifiers, current mirrors, Telescopic and Class-AB op-amps, OTAs and other circuits in cadence design environment. Familiar with poles and zeros analysis, frequency response, feedback systems, stability and frequency compensation.</li>
			<li>CMOS Digital Circuit Design: Designed, simulated and laid out a DPLL that multiplies the input clock frequency from 180MHz to 900MHz, 16-bit Kogge-stone adder, 4-bit binary counter and other basic digital blocks such as flipflops, static and dynamic logic gates, transmission gates, inverters/buffers.
			</li>
			<li>Computer Performance Analysis: Analyzed performance of computer system workloads using statistical analysis techniques such as principal component analysis.
			</li>
			<li>Design and Characterization of Standard Cells for Use in Synthesis Tools: Created a library with standard cells using Complementary Static CMOS logic style. The custom library is used to synthesis a circuit from a logic coded in Verilog using encounter tool of cadence. The same circuit is designed in custom approach using virtuoso of cadence and its characteristics are compared to the characteristics of the synthesized circuit.
